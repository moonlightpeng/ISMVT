we developed a visual inspection system based on deep learning. More precisely, the calculation of gap spacing utilizes the line segment detector of DeepLSD, combining traditional and deep learning techniques to make use of both advantages.

Notice
1 According to different scenarios, camera calibration needs to be completed. Furthermore, The link to the camera used in development is https://item.jd.com/100029997968.html.
2 Depending on different inspection products, the thresholds in image processing need to be set according to actual situations.
3 The environment for deep learning is configured the same as that for DeepLSD （https://github.com/cvg/DeepLSD）.
